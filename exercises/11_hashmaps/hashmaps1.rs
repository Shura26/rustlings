// hashmaps1.rs
//
// A basket of fruits in the form of a hash map needs to be defined. The key
// represents the name of the fruit and the value represents how many of that
// particular fruit is in the basket. You have to put at least three different
// types of fruits (e.g. apple, banana, mango) in the basket and the total count
// of all the fruits should be at least five.
//
// Make me compile and pass the tests!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint hashmaps1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.
