// hashmaps3.rs
//
// A list of scores (one per line) of a soccer match is given. Each line is of
// the form : "<team_1_name>,<team_2_name>,<team_1_goals>,<team_2_goals>"
// Example: England,France,4,2 (England scored 4 goals, France 2).
//
// You have to build a scores table containing the name of the team, the total
// number of goals the team scored, and the total number of goals the team 
// conceded. One approach to build the scores table is to use a Hashmap. 
// The solution is partially written to use a Hashmap, 
// complete it to pass the test.
//
// Make me pass the tests!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint hashmaps3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.




// A structure to store the goal details of a team.
